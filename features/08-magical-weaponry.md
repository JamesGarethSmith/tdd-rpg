> Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.

Add a magical modifier to some of the weapons in the characters data

Feel free to come up with your own ideas but here area few examples:

| Ability       |                      Power                      |
| ------------- | :---------------------------------------------: |
| Life steal    |        Adds health equal to damage done         |
| Double strike | Has a certain chance to do double the challenge |
