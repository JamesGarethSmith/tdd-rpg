# Weaponry

> This sword's name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you remember. The goblins just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible.

Update the weapons in the character data to the following state.

```
{
  ...
  weapon: {
    ...
    damage: [5, 15]
  }
}
```

When a character attacks with this weapon it will do a random amount of damage within the range of 5 and 15.

Obviously not every weapon needs to have the same range. Be creative and have fun!
